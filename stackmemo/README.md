# StackMemo

StackMemo is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Stacks blockchain that allows users to create time-locked, encrypted messages. Users can write messages that are stored securely on the blockchain and can only be accessed after a specified unlock date.

## Features

- Create encrypted, time-locked messages
- Store messages securely on the Stacks blockchain
- Retrieve and decrypt messages after the unlock date has passed
- User authentication with Stacks wallet

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14.18+ or v16+)
- npm or Yarn
- A Stacks wallet (e.g., Leather Wallet)

   ```
   VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
